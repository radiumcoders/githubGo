100 Days of Go — X.com Series

This repository contains the code, notes, and small projects for my 100-day journey learning and building with Go. Each day focuses on a specific concept or mini-project, shared alongside posts on X.com so you can follow along, learn, and suggest ideas.

What you will find here
- A folder per day with runnable examples and notes
- Bite-sized topics that build from fundamentals to real-world tooling
- Tests where helpful to reinforce learning
- Links to the related X.com posts

Recommended daily workflow
- Read: Review the day’s README to understand the goal
- Run: Execute the code and tweak variables to see behavior
- Extend: Try the stretch tasks or add a small feature
- Reflect: Write a short note about what you learned
- Share: Post your progress on X.com with #100DaysOfGo

Follow along on X.com
- Daily posts, threads, and code snippets will be shared at:

- Hashtags: #100DaysOfGo #golang #100DaysOfCode
- Feel free to comment with questions, ideas, or improvements

Contributing and ideas
- Open an issue with a topic suggestion, bug report, or question
- Submit a PR to improve explanations, tests, or examples
- Share learning resources or real-world scenarios to cover

Notes
- Code aims to be simple and clear over clever
- Examples may prioritize learning a concept over production readiness
- Some days include optional stretch goals for deeper exploration

Thanks for stopping by! If you’re learning Go too, join in, share your progress, and let’s build together.
